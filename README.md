# Material You Color Extractor

## Project Overview

Material You Color Extractor is a tool designed to replicate Google's latest color-extraction feature, known as "Material You." This project aims to provide users with a color palette generated from an input image, which can be applied to websites, brands, or any creative project.

## Introduction

Material You is Google's innovative approach to color extraction, where the main colors of a UI or brand are determined from a primary image. The Material You Color Extractor project attempts to replicate this color-extraction mechanism and offers a simple and efficient way to create color palettes based on an input image.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Material You Color Extractor, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd material-you-color-extractor
   ```

2. **Set Up**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python and the required libraries (K-NN clustering, OpenCV, etc.).

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application script to start the color extraction process.

   ```shell
   python material_you_color_extractor.py
   ```

4. **View the Results**: Once the process is complete, open the generated color palette in your preferred web browser.

## How It Works

Material You Color Extractor uses the following process to generate a color palette:

- **Image Input**: The tool takes an input image, which can be a website screenshot, brand logo, or any image containing the desired color scheme.

- **Color Extraction**: It employs K-NN Clustering, a machine learning algorithm, to extract the four main colors from the input image.

- **Color Palette Creation**: The project uses a JavaScript function, "Values.js," to create shades and tints of the base colors and select specific colors from the shade gallery that meet the color requirements of the website or brand.

- **Display in Browser**: The final palette is displayed in your web browser, making it easy to use these colors for your project.

## Features

- Extracts four prominent colors from the input image.
- Provides a quick and customizable color palette for your website or brand.
- Enables you to experiment with different color schemes based on Material You principles.
