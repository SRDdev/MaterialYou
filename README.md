## Documentation
The Project is based on the new Material-You theme based color recognition system introduced by google.<br>
It takes your image and uses K-NN Clustering(an Machine-Learning ALgorithm) to extract the 4 main colors from the image.Then we use a JavaScript function "Values.js" To create shades and tints of the base colors and take out specific colors from the shade gallery which are meeting the color demands of the website,brand.
Then all these colors are displayed to you in your Browser.
